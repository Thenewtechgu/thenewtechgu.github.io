<!-- We aim to develop an English learning app with spell check, text paraphrasing, and pronunciation practice features, providing long-term support for students. We strive to create a user-friendly product that makes language learning more accessible and intelligent. -->
Our current aim is to develop an app that could support learners in Writing, a very important skill in English exams. We focus in two examinations - IELTS and TOEIC, with options for choosing between tasks/questions. Suggestions made will include paraphrasing and structure improvements such as vocabulary and grammar. And importantly, we strive to create a user-friendly product that makes Writing more accessible and intelligent.
